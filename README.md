# Compressor_Decompressor
1. I have created a file compressor to compress and decompress files using one of Java's inbuilt compression algorithms, gZip(fixed speed and compression ratio) 
2. Used Java Swing to develop User Interface
3. Included a feature to decompress any type of compatible file (pdf, jpeg, mp4)
